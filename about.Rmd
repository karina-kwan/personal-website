*View from a hike in Mont Orford.*  

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in biology and mathematics with a focus in molecular biology and statistics. Through my wet lab experience, I got interested in sequencing, bioinformatics and genomics.  

I hope to bridge the two sides of my degree on this site and in my post-grad work.
